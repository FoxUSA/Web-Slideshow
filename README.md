Web-Slideshow
=============

A slide show written using JavaScript and PHP to display images and dynamic content randomly.
This was designed and written to show Graphs and Business KPI's on a smart TV.

How To Use
----------
Simply put images and dynamic php files into the "kpis" folder.

You can create sub folders of images under the "kpis" folder and access them with the following syntax:
http://yoururl.com/PATH/kpi.php?folder=SUB_FOLDER_NAME

Then simply browse to the url above and the script will automatically adjust the image size for you.
I recommend smaller images for enabled devices.
